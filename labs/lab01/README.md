# Setup lab environment

## 1.Description
**In this lab, we will build our own virtual computer security environment managed with VirtualBox, which consists of Parrot Security Linux and Windows server 2019**

* The physical computer you use is called a "Host". The virtual machines that run on it are called "Guests". 

**Prerequisite:**

Your PC must support virtualization which is popular today, following the section 'Check virtualization availability' in the reference to find its availability and enable it.

* Your own PC or laptop needs more than 100GB free disk space for these VMs
  * no less than 8GB RAM
* If you don't have sufficient free space, you may buy an external USB **3.0+** Flash drive or SSD, for example
  * _USB 3.0+ Flash drive_

## 2.Steps
To set up the lab using a `VirtualBox image for Parrot Linux` and a `VHD image for Windows Server 2019`, follow the steps below. This approach skips the installation process by using pre-configured virtual disk images.

### **1. Install VirtualBox**

If you haven't already installed VirtualBox, download and install it from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

### **2. Download the VirtualBox and VHD Images**

- **Parrot Linux**: Download the Parrot Linux VirtualBox image from the [Parrot OS official website](https://www.parrotsec.org). Ensure you choose the `.ova` format, which is a pre-configured VirtualBox appliance.
- **Windows Server 2019**: Download the VHD image from the [Microsoft Evaluation Center](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2019).

### **3. Import the Parrot Linux VirtualBox Image**

1. **Open VirtualBox**.
2. Go to **File** > **Import Appliance**.
3. Browse and select the Parrot Linux `.ova` file you downloaded.
4. Follow the prompts to import the appliance. You can adjust the settings during the import if necessary 
   1. e.g., allocate more RAM or change the virtual disk size
   2. A suggested allocation: 2GB RAM, 60GB disk
5. After the import completes, you should see the Parrot Linux VM listed in VirtualBox.

### **4. Create the Windows Server 2019 VM Using the VHD Image**

1. **Create a New VM**:
   - In VirtualBox, click on **"New"**.
   - Name the VM (e.g., `WindowsServer2019`), select **Type**: Microsoft Windows, and **Version**: Windows 2019 (64-bit).
   - Allocate memory (e.g., 4096 MB).

2. **Attach the VHD Image**:
   - In the **Hard disk** section of the VM creation wizard, choose **Use an existing virtual hard disk file**.
   - Click on the folder icon and browse to select the downloaded Windows Server 2019 `.vhd` file.
   - Finish creating the VM.

### **5. Create and Configure the NAT Network**

1. **Create NAT Network**:
   - Go to **File** > **Preferences** > **Network** > **NAT Networks**.
   - Click the **"+"** button to create a new NAT network.
   - Edit the NAT Network to ensure it is enabled, and note the IP range (e.g., `10.0.2.0/24`).

2. **Attach VMs to the NAT Network**:
   - For each VM (Parrot Linux and Windows Server 2019), go to **Settings** > **Network**.
   - Set **Adapter 1** to **Attached to**: NAT Network.
   - Select the NAT Network you just created.

### **6. Start the VMs**

1. **Start the Parrot Linux VM** by selecting it in VirtualBox and clicking **Start**.
2. **Start the Windows Server 2019 VM** similarly.

### **7. Verify Network Configuration**

Once both VMs are running:

#### **Find the IP Addresses**

- **Windows Server 2019**: Open a command prompt and run:
  ```bash
  ipconfig
  ```
  This will display the IP address assigned to the VM.

- **Parrot Linux**: Open a terminal and run:
  ```bash
  ip addr
  ```
  This will display the IP address assigned to the VM.

#### **Test Communication Between VMs**

- From **Parrot Linux**:
  ```bash
  ping <Windows Server 2019 IP>
  ```
- From **Windows Server 2019**:
  ```bash
  ping <Parrot Linux IP>
  ```


### **8. Install VirtualBox Guest Additions**

Guest Additions need to be installed on both VMs to enable bidirectional copy-paste and shared folders. The steps differ slightly for Parrot Linux and Windows Server 2019.

#### **For Parrot Linux**

1. **Start the Parrot Linux VM**.
2. **Insert the Guest Additions CD**:
   - In VirtualBox, with the VM running, go to **Devices** > **Insert Guest Additions CD Image**.
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Open a terminal in Parrot Linux and run:
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install build-essential dkms linux-headers-$(uname -r)
     ```
4. **Mount and Install Guest Additions**:
   - In the terminal, run:
     ```bash
     sudo mkdir /mnt/cdrom
     sudo mount /dev/cdrom /mnt/cdrom
     sudo /mnt/cdrom/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
     ```
5. **Reboot the VM**:
   - After installation completes, reboot the VM:
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     ```

#### **For Windows Server 2019**

1. **Start the Windows Server 2019 VM**.
2. **Insert the Guest Additions CD**:
   - In VirtualBox, with the VM running, go to **Devices** > **Insert Guest Additions CD Image**.
3. **Install Guest Additions**:
   - When the CD is detected, run the installer (`VBoxWindowsAdditions.exe`) from the CD drive.
   - Follow the prompts to install Guest Additions.
   - Reboot the VM after installation.

### **9. Enable Bidirectional Copy-Paste**

1. **With the VM Powered On**:
   - Go to **Devices** > **Shared Clipboard**.
   - Select **Bidirectional**.
   - Go to **Devices** > **Drag and Drop**.
   - Select **Bidirectional**.

Repeat these steps for both the Parrot Linux and Windows Server 2019 VMs.

### **10. Create Shared Folders**

Shared folders allow you to share files between your host system and the guest VMs.

#### **Set Up Shared Folders in VirtualBox**

1. **With the VM Powered Off**:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Shared Folders**.
   - Click the **"+"** icon on the right to add a new shared folder.
   - Choose a folder path on your host machine.
   - Set the **Folder Name** (this is how it will appear in the VM).
   - Check **Auto-mount** and optionally **Make Permanent**.

   Repeat this for both the Parrot Linux and Windows Server 2019 VMs.

#### **Access Shared Folders in Parrot Linux**

1. **After Booting the VM**:
   - The shared folder should automatically appear in the `/media/sf_<folder_name>` directory.
   - If it doesn't appear, add the user to the `vboxsf` group:
     ```bash
     sudo usermod -aG vboxsf $USER
     ```
   - Log out and log back in, or reboot the VM to apply the changes.

#### **Access Shared Folders in Windows Server 2019**

1. **After Booting the VM**:
   - Open **File Explorer**.
   - The shared folder should be listed as a network drive under **This PC**.
   - You can now access the shared folder directly from Windows Explorer.

### **11. Final Verification**

After setting up the shared folders and enabling bidirectional copy-paste:

- **Copy-Paste Test**: Try copying text or files between the host and the guest VMs to verify that bidirectional copy-paste is working.
- **Shared Folders Test**: Place files in the shared folder on the host and verify that they appear in both VMs.

### **Conclusion**

By using a pre-configured VirtualBox image for Parrot Linux and a VHD for Windows Server 2019, you save time on OS installation and quickly set up a virtual lab. After importing the images and configuring the NAT network, the VMs should be able to communicate with each other, which you can verify using ping commands. You've enabled bidirectional copy-paste and configured shared folders for easy file transfer between the host and the guest VMs, improving the usability of your virtual environment.
