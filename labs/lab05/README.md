# DoS Attack

## 1. Description
In a denial-of-service attack (DoS attack), the attackers prevent some or all legitimate requests from being fulfilled by flooding the targeted machine or network with superfluous requests. The service interrupt may be temporarily or indefinitely. A successful DoS attack causes a breach of the availability of the CIA triad.

DoS attacks are typically classified into [two categories](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/blob/master/9-Denial-of-Service/0-Introduction.md):
- Buffer overflow attacks
- Flood attacks, mainly in the form of distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack)

In this lab, both the Windows Server and Parrot Linux are required.

## 2. Tasks: 
###  Task 1: [SYN Flooding Windows web service](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/blob/master/9-Denial-of-Service/1-SYN-Flooding.md)
- On Windows server
  - [Turn off](https://samsclass.info/123/proj10/123p2win.htm) 
    -  firewall and 
    -  antivirus protection
    -  üíª disabled firewall and antivirus
  - [Install IIS](https://computingforgeeks.com/install-and-configure-iis-web-server-on-windows-server/) and show the default website can be accessed both 
    -  locally 
       -  üíª home webpage in the browser on Windows
    -  from Parrot Linux
       -  üíª home webpage in the browser on Parrot
  - Install [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
    -  run Wireshark and start capturing packets
    -  üíª a running Wireshark
- On Parrot Linux
  - üíª Launch SYN flooding attack on Windows web service using hping3
     ```bash
     # HTTP is on port number: 80
     hping3 -S [Windows IP address] -a [Parrot IP address] -p 80 --flood
     # HTTPS in on port number: 443
     ```
- Go back to Windows server
  - üíª show the attack results in Wireshark
  - Open Task Manager, check the *performance* tab, show 
    - üíª Ethernet communication and
    - üíª CPU usage

###  Task 2: [DDoS attack Parrot web service using HOIC from Windows](https://github.com/Samsar4/Ethical-Hacking-Labs/blob/master/9-Denial-of-Service/2-DDoS-using-HOIC.md)
- On Parrot 
  - üíª Launch a simple HTTP server
    ```bash
    #  1. launch a simple HTTP server
    sudo python3 -m http.server 80
    #  2. üíª access locally
    http://localhost
    #  3. üíª access from Windows: http://ParotIP
    ```
  - *In case you cannot access the HTTP server from Windows 2019*, you may try installing other Windows and connect them to the same NAT network as Parrot such as
    - [Windows server 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2022)
    - [Windows 11 development environment](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/virtual-machines/)
    - [Windows 10 Enterprise](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/download-windows-10-enterprise)    
  -  üíª Run Wireshark and start capturing packets
-  On Windows server, 
  - download and install [High Orbit Ion Cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Orbit_Ion_Cannon) 
  - üíª Run HOIC and add the target as Parrot
    - URL: http://ParrotIP
    - Power: high
    - Booster: GenericBoost.hoic
  - THREADS: 30
  - FIRE THE LAZER!
- Go back to Parrot Linux,
  - üíª show the attack results in Wireshark

## Task 3: Raven-Storm
[Raven-Storm](https://github.com/Tmpertor/Raven-Storm) is a powerful DDoS toolkit for penetration tests. It can launch DoS attacks on several network layers through modules. In this extra task, attack Windows from the Parrot Linux.
-  Install Raven-Storm on Parrot Linux
   -  üíª startup of Raven-Storm
-  Launch the following modules to attack Windows
  - l3 for ping
  - l4 for udp/tcp services
  - l7 for websites
  - arp for local devices
- For each attack, show at least two screenshots, i.e. at least 8 üíª totally:
  - üíª one on Parrot shows the attack
  - üíª the other on Windows shows the result 


## 3. Report
Write a report about the process you complete the tasks above, key screen snapshots are needed as evidences.
