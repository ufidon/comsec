# **Intrusion Detection**

## **Description**
In this lab, we will configure Suricata, an open-source intrusion detection system (IDS), on a Ubuntu virtual machine. The lab will simulate a real-world scenario where a server is monitored for potential security breaches. Parrot Linux will act as an attacking machine to generate different types of network traffic. The goal is to test how effectively Suricata detects malicious activity, such as port scanning, brute force attacks, and exploitation attempts.

Both VMs (Ubuntu Server and Parrot Linux) will be connected through a VirtualBox NAT network to simulate network traffic while retaining internet access.

## **Lab Prerequisites**
- VirtualBox installed and configured with a **NAT network** where both virtual machines (VMs) are connected.
- **Ubuntu Linux** and **Parrot Linux** VMs installed and properly connected to the same NAT network.
- A basic understanding of IDS concepts and network monitoring.

## **Lab Objectives**
By the end of this lab, you will:
1. Install and configure Suricata on a Ubuntu Server VM.
2. Generate both benign and malicious network traffic using Parrot Linux to test Suricataâ€™s detection capabilities.
3. Analyze and interpret Suricata logs for traffic detection.

## **Task 3: Testing Suricata with Baseline and Malicious Traffic**

### **Step 1: Generating Baseline Traffic (Normal)**
1. **Ping the Ubuntu Server from Parrot Linux:**
   - From Parrot Linux, open the terminal and run a simple ping to the Ubuntu VM's IP:
     ```
     ping <Ubuntu-VM-IP>
     ```
     ðŸ’» ping output
   - Suricata should log this ICMP traffic in the `eve.json` file (assuming the test rule for ICMP is active).
      - ðŸ’» logged ICMP traffic.

2. **Perform File Transfer via SSH:**
   - Use `scp` to transfer a file from Parrot to the Ubuntu VM, assuming SSH is enabled on Ubuntu.
     ```
     echo 'hello ubuntu.' > file.txt
     scp file.txt user@<Ubuntu-VM-IP>:/home/seed/file.txt
     ```
      ðŸ’» transferred file on both Parrot and Ubuntu
   - Monitor Suricata logs for this traffic. It should not generate an alert as it's benign.
      - ðŸ’» logged scp traffic.

### **Step 2: Generating Malicious Traffic**
1. **Perform a Port Scan Using Nmap:**
   - From Parrot Linux, scan the Ubuntu VM for open ports:
     ```bash
     # TCP SYN scan (also known as a half-open scan)
     # You will learn more in Ethical Hacking
     nmap -sS <Ubuntu-VM-IP>
     ```
     ðŸ’» Scan results
   - Suricata should trigger alerts for port scanning, as many default rules detect Nmap scans.
      - ðŸ’» Alerts and logs

2. **Brute Force Attack with Hydra:**
   - Use the parallelized login cracker [hydra](https://www.kali.org/tools/hydra/) tool on Parrot Linux to brute-force SSH, telnet or ftp login attempts.
   - Download the collection of popular passwords saved as [rockyou](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt)
     - SSH:
       ```
       hydra -l admin -P /path-to/rockyou.txt ssh://<Ubuntu-VM-IP>
       ```
       ðŸ’» Brute-forcing SSH login attempt result
     - telnet:
       ```
       hydra -l admin -P /path-to/rockyou.txt telnet://<Ubuntu-VM-IP>
       ```
       ðŸ’» Brute-forcing telnet login attempt result
     - ftp:
       ```
       hydra -l admin -P /path-to/rockyou.txt ftp://<Ubuntu-VM-IP>
       ```
       ðŸ’» Brute-forcing ftp login attempt results
   - Suricata will generate alerts for brute force attempts.
      - ðŸ’» Alerts and logs

3. **Exploit Vulnerabilities with Metasploit:**
   - Use Metasploit on Parrot Linux to exploit a known vulnerability on the Ubuntu VM (even if patched, Suricata should log the attempt).
   - Example: Search for Ubuntu samba related exploits in Metasploit:
     ```
     msfconsole
     search name:samba platform:linux
     use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
     set RHOSTS <Ubuntu-VM-IP>
     exploit
     ```
   - ðŸ’» Attack results on Parrot Linux
   - ðŸ’» Alerts and logs

## **Task 4: Monitoring and Analyzing Suricata Logs**

#### **Step 1: Viewing Logs**
1. **EReal-time Monitoring with EveBox:**
   - Use Evebox to see the detected events in JSON format.
   - ðŸ’» Highlight the logged attacks

#### **Step 2: Analyzing the Traffic**
- Look for the following in the logs:
  - ðŸ’» ICMP traffic from Parrot to Ubuntu (from the ping).
  - ðŸ’» Port scanning alerts from Nmap.
  - ðŸ’» Brute force detection from Hydra.
  - ðŸ’» Exploit attempts from Metasploit.

- Identify patterns in the traffic, false positives, or any missed attacks. This will help you tune Suricataâ€™s rules.

## **Conclusion**
In this lab, you have successfully installed and configured Suricata on a Ubuntu VM and tested its ability to detect various types of network traffic using Parrot Linux. By generating both normal and malicious traffic, you evaluated Suricataâ€™s effectiveness in logging and alerting on security events. 

This lab provided a solid foundation for understanding how IDS systems like Suricata work in real-world environments and how they can be used to strengthen network security.
