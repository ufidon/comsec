## Intrusion Prevention

In this lab, we learn configuring Windows firewall rules, monitoring firewall activity, and troubleshooting firewall-related issues.

### **Windows Firewall Features and Capabilities**

**Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** is a powerful tool built into Windows operating systems, including Windows Server 2019/2022, to manage and control inbound and outbound network traffic. 

Windows Firewall offers flexibility, allowing you to finely control traffic flows both to and from your server, thus improving the serverâ€™s security posture.

Its core functions are to protect the server from unauthorized access and help secure network communications. Key features include:

#### **1. Three Profiles for Different Network Environments**
- **Domain**: Applied when the server is connected to a corporate domain network.
- **Private**: Used for trusted networks like home or small office networks.
- **Public**: Used for public networks like Wi-Fi at a coffee shop. It is the most restrictive profile.

Each profile allows different rules to be applied based on the network's security requirements.

#### **2. Inbound and Outbound Rules**
- **Inbound Rules**: Control incoming traffic to the server. These rules can allow or block traffic from specific ports, programs, or IP addresses.
- **Outbound Rules**: Control outgoing traffic from the server to external networks or other devices.

#### **3. Predefined Rules**
Windows Firewall has a set of predefined rules for common services such as **Remote Desktop**, **File Sharing**, **ICMP** (ping), and more, which can be easily enabled or customized.

#### **4. Granular Control**
- **Port-Based Rules**: Allow or block traffic based on port numbers (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).
- **Program-Based Rules**: Control network traffic for specific programs or executables.
- **Protocol-Based Rules**: Rules based on protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
- **IP-Based Rules**: Filter traffic by specific IP addresses or IP ranges.

#### **5. Connection Security Rules (IPsec)**
Windows Firewall supports **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**, which can be used to secure communications between hosts on a network by encrypting traffic and enforcing authentication for network connections.

#### **6. Logging and Monitoring**
Windows Firewall provides logging capabilities to monitor successful and dropped connections. Logs can help track what traffic is allowed or blocked, which is crucial for troubleshooting.

#### **7. Network Isolation**
Firewall can enforce **network isolation** rules that control access to the server based on membership in certain network subnets, IP ranges, or based on the computer's domain status.

#### **8. Group Policy Integration**
In domain environments, firewall settings can be configured and enforced centrally through **Group Policy**, ensuring that all machines in the domain adhere to the same security policies.

### **Task 1: Configure Basic Windows Firewall Settings**

1. **Launch Windows Defender Firewall** on the Windows Server VM.
   - Open **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.

2. **Configure Inbound Rules**:
   - **Allow HTTP (Port 80)**: Create a rule to allow incoming web traffic.
   - **Block ICMP (Ping)**: Create a rule to block ICMP traffic.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide to Configuring Inbound Rules**

##### **1. Open Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**
- Press **Windows + R**, type `wf.msc`, and press **Enter**.
- This opens the **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** console.

##### **2. Navigate to Inbound Rules**
- On the left pane, click **Inbound Rules** to view a list of all active inbound rules.

##### **3. Create a New Inbound Rule**
- On the right-hand side, click **New Rule**. This launches the **New Inbound Rule Wizard**.
  
##### **4. Choose Rule Type**
In the wizard, choose the type of rule you want to create:
- **Program**: Controls traffic for a specific application.
- **Port**: Controls traffic to a specific TCP/UDP port.
- **Predefined**: Choose from predefined rules for services like **Remote Desktop** or **File Sharing**.
- **Custom**: Create a custom rule based on specific conditions (protocol, program, port, IP address).

For example, to allow HTTP traffic:
- Select **Port** and click **Next**.

##### **5. Configure Port**
- Choose **TCP** or **UDP** based on your requirement (e.g., HTTP uses TCP).
- Specify the port number (e.g., **80** for HTTP).
- Click **Next**.

##### **6. Choose Action**
- **Allow the connection**: Permit the traffic.
- **Block the connection**: Deny the traffic.

Choose **Allow the connection** and click **Next**.

##### **7. Choose the Profile**
Select the profiles (Domain, Private, Public) to which this rule should apply, depending on the network environment. Typically, if you're running a web server, you might allow traffic on **Private** and **Public**.

##### **8. Name the Rule**
- Give the rule a descriptive name (e.g., **Allow HTTP Traffic**).
- Click **Finish** to create the rule.

##### **9. Test the Rule**
After creating the rule, test it by using a client machine (like your **Parrot Linux VM**) to access the service. For example, if you created an HTTP rule, you could access it using `curl` or a web browser.

3. **Configure Outbound Rules**:
   - **Block All Traffic Except HTTP**: Create a rule that blocks all outbound traffic except on port 80 (HTTP).

#### **Step-by-Step Guide to Configuring Outbound Rules**

##### **1. Open Outbound Rules**
- On the left pane, click **Outbound Rules** to see the current outbound rules.

##### **2. Create a New Outbound Rule**
- Click **New Rule** from the right-hand side to launch the **New Outbound Rule Wizard**.

##### **3. Choose Rule Type**
Select the appropriate type (e.g., **Port** or **Program**).

For example, to block all traffic except HTTP:
- Select **Port** and click **Next**.

##### **4. Configure Port**
- Choose **TCP** and specify port **80** (for HTTP).
- Click **Next**.

##### **5. Choose Action**
- Select **Allow the connection** for traffic on port 443.
- Click **Next**.

##### **6. Choose Profile**
Select the profiles (Domain, Private, Public) this rule should apply to.

##### **7. Name the Rule**
Give the rule a name (e.g., **Allow HTTP Outbound**).
- Click **Finish**.

##### **8. Block All Other Outbound Traffic**
- To block all other outbound traffic, create a separate **block rule**:
  - Repeat the process, but instead of selecting **Allow**, choose **Block** for **All Ports** except **443**.

##### **9. Test the Rule**
After creating the outbound rule, try accessing external websites using HTTP (port 80)from a client machine. Only HTTP connections should succeed.

4. **Switch Between Firewall Profiles**:
   - Test different profiles (Domain, Private, Public) to observe how firewall settings differ across network environments.

### **Task 2: Test Windows Firewall Settings Using Parrot Linux**

1. **Basic Connectivity Tests**:
   - **Ping the Windows Server** from Parrot Linux:
     ```bash
     ping <Windows_Server_IP>
     ```
     Ensure ICMP is blocked.

   - **Access HTTP Services**:
     - Use curl from Parrot Linux to access the Windows Server:
       ```bash
       curl http://<Windows_Server_IP>
       ```
     - Confirm that port 80 (HTTP) traffic is allowed.

2. **Nmap Scanning**:
   - Run an **nmap** scan from Parrot Linux:
     ```bash
     nmap -Pn <Windows_Server_IP>
     ```
     Ensure only allowed services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) are visible.

### **Task 3: Monitor Firewall Activity on Windows Server**

1. **Enable Firewall Logging**:
   - Go to **Monitoring** in the **Windows Defender Firewall** console and configure logging for both dropped packets and successful connections.

2. **Review Firewall Logs**:
   - Logs are located at: `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log`.
   - Use PowerShell to view logs in real time:
     ```powershell
     Get-Content -Path "C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log" -Wait
     ```

3. **Monitor in Real-Time**:
   - Use **Resource Monitor** to view real-time network activity and observe blocked or allowed connections.

---

### **Task 4: Troubleshoot Firewall-Related Issues**

1. **Simulate Blocked RDP Connection**:
   - **Block RDP Traffic**: Create a rule to block inbound RDP on port 3389.
   - Attempt to connect via RDP from Parrot Linux, then troubleshoot and unblock the service.

2. **Troubleshoot HTTP Service Unavailability**:
   - **Block HTTP Traffic**: Create a rule to block port 80.
   - Try accessing the web service from Parrot Linux. Investigate using logs and remove the block to restore service.

3. **Resolve ICMP Block**:
   - Disable the ICMP blocking rule temporarily, test with ping, and then reapply the rule to allow ICMP from a specific IP range.

---

### **Task 5: Automate Firewall Configuration and Export Rules**

1. **Automate Rule Creation with PowerShell**:
   - Use PowerShell to create and apply firewall rules:
     ```powershell
     New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "Allow HTTP" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 80
     ```

2. **Export and Import Firewall Configurations**:
   - Export firewall rules:
     ```powershell
     netsh advfirewall export "C:\path\to\firewall_config.wfw"
     ```
   - Import firewall rules on another server:
     ```powershell
     netsh advfirewall import "C:\path\to\firewall_config.wfw"
     ```
