# Intrusion Prevention

In this lab, we learn configuring Windows firewall rules, monitoring firewall activity, and troubleshooting firewall-related issues.

## **Windows Firewall Features and Capabilities**

**Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** is a powerful tool built into Windows operating systems, including Windows Server 2019/2022, to manage and control inbound and outbound network traffic. 

Windows Firewall offers flexibility, allowing you to finely control traffic flows both to and from your server, thus improving the server‚Äôs security posture.

Its core functions are to protect the server from unauthorized access and help secure network communications. Key features include:

### **1. Three Profiles for Different Network Environments**
- **Domain**: Applied when the server is connected to a corporate domain network.
- **Private**: Used for trusted networks like home or small office networks.
- **Public**: Used for public networks like Wi-Fi at a coffee shop. It is the most restrictive profile.

Each profile allows different rules to be applied based on the network's security requirements.

### **2. Inbound and Outbound Rules**
- **Inbound Rules**: Control incoming traffic to the server. These rules can allow or block traffic from specific ports, programs, or IP addresses.
- **Outbound Rules**: Control outgoing traffic from the server to external networks or other devices.

### **3. Predefined Rules**
Windows Firewall has a set of predefined rules for common services such as **Remote Desktop**, **File Sharing**, **ICMP** (ping), and more, which can be easily enabled or customized.

### **4. Granular Control**
- **Port-Based Rules**: Allow or block traffic based on port numbers (e.g., HTTP on port 80, HTTPS on port 443).
- **Program-Based Rules**: Control network traffic for specific programs or executables.
- **Protocol-Based Rules**: Rules based on protocols like TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.
- **IP-Based Rules**: Filter traffic by specific IP addresses or IP ranges.

### **5. Connection Security Rules (IPsec)**
Windows Firewall supports **IPsec (Internet Protocol Security)**, which can be used to secure communications between hosts on a network by encrypting traffic and enforcing authentication for network connections.

### **6. Logging and Monitoring**
Windows Firewall provides logging capabilities to monitor successful and dropped connections. Logs can help track what traffic is allowed or blocked, which is crucial for troubleshooting.

### **7. Network Isolation**
Firewall can enforce **network isolation** rules that control access to the server based on membership in certain network subnets, IP ranges, or based on the computer's domain status.

### **8. Group Policy Integration**
In domain environments, firewall settings can be configured and enforced centrally through **Group Policy**, ensuring that all machines in the domain adhere to the same security policies.

In the wizard, choose the type of rule you want to create:
- **Program**: Controls traffic for a specific application.
- **Port**: Controls traffic to a specific TCP/UDP port.
- **Predefined**: Choose from predefined rules for services like **Remote Desktop** or **File Sharing**.
- **Custom**: Create a custom rule based on specific conditions (protocol, program, port, IP address).

For example, to allow HTTP/HTTPS traffic:
- Select **Port** and click **Next**.

#### **5. Configure Port**
- Choose **TCP** or **UDP** based on your requirement (e.g., HTTP/HTTPS uses TCP).
- Specify the port number (e.g., **80** for HTTP, **443** for HTTPS).
- Click **Next**.

#### **6. Choose Action**
- **Allow the connection**: Permit the traffic.
- **Block the connection**: Deny the traffic.

Choose **Allow the connection** and click **Next**.

#### **7. Choose the Profile**
Select the profiles (Domain, Private, Public) to which this rule should apply, depending on the network environment. Typically, if you're running a web server, you might allow traffic on **Private** and **Public**.

#### **8. Name the Rule**
- Give the rule a descriptive name (e.g., **Allow HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**).
- Click **Finish** to create the rule.
- üíª the completed HTTP/HTTPS rule


### üî≠ Find methods online to create a rule to block ICMP traffic
- üíª the completed ICMP blocking rule


‚ë¢ **Configure Outbound Rules**:
   - **Block All Traffic Except HTTP/HTTPS**: Create a rule that blocks all outbound traffic except on port 80 (HTTP) and port 443 (HTTPS).

### **Step-by-Step Guide to Configuring Outbound Rules**

#### **1. Open Outbound Rules**
- On the left pane, click **Outbound Rules** to see the current outbound rules.

#### **2. Create a New Outbound Rule**
- Click **New Rule** from the right-hand side to launch the **New Outbound Rule Wizard**.

- Click **Next**.

#### **5. Choose Action**
- Select **Allow the connection** for traffic on port 80 and 443.
- Click **Next**.

#### **6. Choose Profile**
Select the profiles (Domain, Private, Public) this rule should apply to.

- üéè Which one should you choose? Justify your choice.

#### **7. Name the Rule**
Give the rule a name (e.g., **Allow HTTP/HTTPS Outbound**).
- Click **Finish**.
- üíª the complete rule

#### **8. Block All Other Outbound Traffic**
- To block all other outbound traffic, create a separate **block rule**:
  - Repeat the process, but instead of selecting **Allow**, choose **Block** for **All Ports** except **80 and 443**.
  - üéè Compare the **allow rule** and the **block rule** just created
  - üéè Which one do you prefer? Why?

## **Task 2: Test Windows Firewall Settings Using Parrot Linux**

### **1. Test the Inbound Rule**
1. **Basic Connectivity Tests**:
   - **Ping the Windows Server** from Parrot Linux:
     ```bash
     ping <Windows_Server_IP>
     ```
     - üíª Ensure ICMP is blocked.

2. **Nmap Scanning**:
   - Run an **nmap** scan from Parrot Linux:
     ```bash
     nmap -Pn <Windows_Server_IP>
     ```
     - üíª Ensure only allowed services (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) are visible.

3. Test the HTTP/HTTPS inbound rule using your **Parrot Linux VM** to access the web service on the Windows VM. You could test it using `curl` or a web browser.
   - üéè In a terminal, access Windows webserver using `curl`
      ```bash
      curl http://windows_ip
      ```
      - üíª A successful access by curl
   - üéè Access Windows webserver using a web browser.
     - üíª A successful access by the web browser
   - üéè `Optional`: Is HTTPS available on your Windows VM?
     - If you are interested in setting up HTTPS, refer to [Configure an HTTPS binding for a Windows Server CA](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/configure-https-binding-windows-server-ca?view=sc-om-2025).

### **2. Test the Outbound Rule**
After creating the outbound rule, try accessing external websites using HTTP (port 80) and HTTPS (port 443) from the Windows VM. Only HTTP/HTTPS connections should succeed. From a browser, 
- üíª Find an HTTP website and access it such as
  - `http`://httpforever.com/
  - üéè Is it very hard to find an HTTP website? Why?
- üíª Find an HTTPS website and access it such as
  - `https`://www.google.com
  - üéè Is it very each to find an HTTPS website? Why?
  - üéè What do you get when you try to access `http`://www.google.com

1. **Optional: Switch Between Firewall Profiles**:
   - Test different profiles (Domain, Private, Public) to observe how firewall settings differ across network environments.

## **Task 3: Monitor Firewall Activity on Windows Server**

1. **Enable Firewall Logging**:
   - Refer to [See Firewall Activity in Windows Defender Firewall Logs](https://help.pdq.com/hc/en-us/articles/360053040851-See-Firewall-Activity-in-Windows-Defender-Firewall-Logs) 
   - Go to **Monitoring** in the **Windows Defender Firewall** console and configure logging for both dropped packets and successful connections.
   - üíª completed configuration

2. **Review Firewall Logs**:
   - Logs are located at: `C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log`.
   - Use PowerShell to view logs in real time:
     ```powershell
     Get-Content -Path "C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\Firewall\pfirewall.log" -Wait
     ```
   - üíª sample logs

3. **Monitor in Real-Time**:
   - Refer to [monitor network](https://askleo.com/monitor-network/)
     - Server Manager ‚Üí Tools ‚Üí Resource Monitor ‚Üí Network
   - üíª Use **Resource Monitor** to view real-time network activity and observe blocked or allowed connections.

## **Task 4: Troubleshoot Firewall-Related Issues**

1. **Simulate Blocked RDP Connection**:
   - [Enable Windows remote desktop](https://www.anyviewer.com/how-to/enable-remote-desktop-on-windows-server-2019-0007.html)
     - üíª Test Windows RDP is available using nmap and Remmina remote desktop client from Parrot.
   - üéè **Block RDP Traffic**: Create a rule to block inbound RDP on port 3389.
   - üéè Attempt to connect via RDP from Parrot Linux, then troubleshoot and unblock the service.

2. **Troubleshoot HTTP/HTTPS Service Unavailability**:
   - üéè **Block HTTP/HTTPS Traffic**: Create a rule to block port 80 and 443.
   - üéè Try accessing the web service from Parrot Linux. Investigate using curl and remove the block to restore service.

3. **Block C&C (Command & Control)**
   - üéè With the rule of `blocking all outbound except HTTP/HTTPS` enabled, try the trojan created in Lab04, can you control the Windows VM? Why?
   - üéè Disable the blocking all outbound rule, try the trojan again, you should be able to C&C the Windows VM now.
   - üéè Enable the blocking all outbound rule and delete the trojan.
4. **Resolve ICMP Block**:
   - üéè Disable the ICMP blocking rule temporarily, test with ping, and then reapply the rule to allow ICMP from a specific IP range containing your Parrot IP.
