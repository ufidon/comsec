What is computer security?
---
- It is about [information security](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/information_security)
- The protection of information and information systems 
- Avoid unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of digital assets
- Provide confidentiality, integrity, and availability - the CIA triad


Information security attributes and protection
---
- ![isap](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/CIAJMK1209-en.svg)
- the CIA composed in hardware, software and communication
- protection and prevention at three layers: physical, personal and organizational


CIA triad
---
![cia triad](../../figs/cia.svg)

- Confidentiality
  - preserves authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure
  - protects personal privacy and proprietary information
  - *break: information leaked*
- Integrity
  - guards against improper information modification or destruction
  - assures system integrity or soundness
  - ensures information non-repudiation and authenticity
  - *break: information corrupted*
- Availability
  - ensures timely and reliable access to and use of information
  - *break: degraded or unavailable*
- Authenticity
  - identity setup and verification
- Accountability
  - or non-repudiation, keeps every activity traceable

Levels of Impact on organizational operations, assets, or individuals
- Low: a limited adverse effect
- Moderate: a serious adverse effect
- High: a severe or catastrophic adverse effect

```


System resources or assets
---
- hardware, software and data
- communication facilities and networks


Vulnerability, threat and attack
---
- A vulnerability is a weak point of a system
- A threat is a potential security harm to an asset
- An attack is a threat in action


Attack surfaces
---
- Reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system
  - Network attack surface
    - open ports and services
  - Software attack surface
    - code receiving and processing inputs
  - Human attack surface
    - employees vulnerable to social engineering attacks


Attack surface analysis
---
- assesses the scale and severity of threats to a system
- assisted with an attack tree 
  - represents a set of optional techniques for exploiting vulnerabilities


Attack types
---
- Active attack
  - replay
  - masquerade (spoof)
  - tamper
  - denial of service (DoS)
- Passive attack
  - sniff
- Inside attack
- Outside attack


Attacks vs. Consequences
---
- Attacks (threat actions) engender threat consequences

| Attack | Consequence | CIA break |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ‚Ä¢ Exposure<br>‚Ä¢ Interception<br>‚Ä¢ Inference<br>‚Ä¢ Intrusion | ‚Ä¢ Unauthorized disclosure | Confidentiality |
| ‚Ä¢ Masquerade<br>‚Ä¢ Falsification<br>‚Ä¢ Repudiation | ‚Ä¢ Deception | System integrity or data integrity |
| ‚Ä¢ Incapacitation<br>‚Ä¢ Corruption<br>‚Ä¢ Obstruction | ‚Ä¢ Disruption | Availability of system integrity |
| ‚Ä¢ Misappropriation<br> ‚Ä¢ Misuse | ‚Ä¢ Usurpation | System integrity |

How to measure the breach of CIA quantitatively?

- [Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document)
- [CVSS calculator](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1)


How to achieve CIA?
---
Through a structured risk management process that involves: 
- Identify and evaluate 
  - information, related assets and vulnerabilities
  - potential threats, risks and impacts
- Select, design and apply
  - cybersecurity tools to avoid, mitigate, share, or accept the risks
  - intrusion detection and prevention systems

[Fundamental security design principles](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/cae/pdf/unclass-cae-cd_ku.pdf)
---
- Isolation
  - Separation (of domains): Least common mechanism
  - Separation of privilege: multiple privilege attributes are required to access restricted resources
  - Modularity
  - Layering
  - Encapsulation
- Simplicity (of design)
  - Least Privilege
  - Minimization (of implementation)
  - Reduce attack surfaces
  - Least Astonishment
  - Economy of mechanism: the security solution must be affordable
- Usability
  - Fail Safe Defaults / Fail Secure: access is denied by default
  - Complete mediation: every access must be checked with the access control mechanism
  - Psychological acceptability
- Open Design: transparent and open to public scrutiny


Computer Security Strategy
---
- Security policy or specification: what to do?
  - User friendliness vs. Security
  - Cost of security vs. Cost of failure and recovery
- Security mechanism or implementation: how?
  - with [NIST Cybersecurity Framework functions](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/CSWP/NIST.CSWP.29.ipd.pdf)
    - ![NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0](../../figs/NISTCybersecurityFramework2.png)
- Assurance and evaluation: will it work?
  - confidence about the security
  - not mathematical or formal proof
