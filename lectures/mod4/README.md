# [Access Control (AC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control)

What can you do in an information system (IS)?
---
- [FIPS 201-3 definition](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/access_control)
  - *granting or denying specific requests* to 
    - obtain and use information and related services 
    - enter specific physical facilities
- [RFC 4949 definition](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4949)
  - regulates use of system resources according to a security policy 
  - permits only to authorized entities


## Access Control Principles

üñäÔ∏è Practice
---
- Computer security is maily about access control
- Explore [TABLE D-1: MAPPING ACCESS CONTROL REQUIREMENTS TO CONTROLS](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-171r2.pdf) in NIST SP 800-171 for
  - Basic AC security requirements
  - Derived AC security requirements

- All activities are under audit


## Subjects access objects with certain access rights


Subject
---
- an entity capable of accessing objects
- the process that represents user or application
  - takes on the attributes of the user, such as access rights
-  is typically held accountable for its actions
   -  the actions may be recorded by an audit trail 
- belongs to one of three classes with different access rights
  - owner of the IS resources
  - group with identical access rights for each member
    - a user may belong to multiple groups
  - world (others) includes anyone other than owner and group
    - have least amount of access


Objects
---
- an IS resource under access control
- contains information, such as
  - files, directories
  - records, blocks, tables, databases
  - pages, segments, devices
  - messages, mailboxes, programs


Access Rights
---
- the operations that a subject can do on an object
- typical access rights
  - create, delete
  - read, write
  - search, execute


Access Control Policies
---
- integrated in authorization systems
- dictate what types of access are permitted, under what circumstances, and by whom
- include four typical categories
  - Discretionary access control (DAC)
    - by the requestor's volition
  - Mandatory access control (MAC)
    - by the requestor's clearance
    - required for military information security
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)
    - by the requestor's roles
  - Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
    - by related attributes of the requestor, resources and environmental conditions
- these categories are not mutually exclusive



[Discretionary Access Control (DAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discretionary_access_control)
---
- restricts access to objects based on 
  - the identity of subjects
  - groups to which they belong
- allow pass of access rights to other subjects
- implemented in [access matrix (table)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_matrix) $A[s_i,r_j]$ with
  - left-most column of subjects $s_i$
  - head row of resources $r_j$
  - cells of access rights $a_{s_i,r_j}$


A access matrix
---
| S/A/R | Resource 1 | Resource 2 | Resource 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Subject 1 |  | read | own |
| Subject 2 | read<br>write | | write |
| Subject 3 | read | | read<br>write |


Access control list(ACL) and capability ticket
---
- each column $r_j$ is an **access control list(ACL)**
  - lists subjects and their access rights on this resource
  - unlisted subjects are assigned a default set of rights
  - convenient to determine which subjects have which access rights to a specified resource
  - hard to determine all access rights for a particular subject
- each row $s_i$ is a **capability ticket**
  - specifies authorized objects and operations for a particular subject
  - convenient to determine the set of access rights for a given subject
  - can be given to other subjects
  - must be unforgeable. How?
    - let the OS hold  all tickets on behalf of subjects
    - add a message authentication code (MAC) to each ticket
      - the MAC is verified by the relevant resource whenever access is requested
  - hard to determine subjects and their access rights on a given resource


Authorization table
---
- like access matrix but not sparse
- each row specifies one access right of one subject to one resource
  - sorting the table by subject gives capability lists
  - sorting the table by resource gives access control lists
- can be easily implemented with relational database


[Graham‚ÄìDenning model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham%E2%80%93Denning_model)
---
- extended from DAC model to 
  - a general model 
  - associates capabilities with protection domains, such as
    - user domain (user mode)
    - kernel domain (kernel mode)
- assumes
  - a set of subjects
  - a set of objects
    - processes, devices, memory locations or regions, *subjects*
  - a set of rules that govern the access of subjects to subjects/objects
- defines a protection state as a snapshot of the access control matrix $A$
  - $A[S,X]$ : a string represents access attributes
    - specify the access rights of subject $S$ to object $X$


An access control matrix
---
- the star ‚ãÜ is a copy flag, indicates the attribute can be transferred

| S/A/O | S1 | S2 | S3 | File 1 | Process 1 | Device 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| S1 |  | control | own | read* | wakeup | owner |
| S2 | control<br>own | |  | write |  | seek* |
| S3 | control | |  | | stop | |


Steps triggered by an access attempt
---
- A subject $S_0$ issues a request $R$ of type $T$ for object $X$
- $R$ triggers the system to generate a message $(S_0, T, X)$ to the access controller
- The controller lookup the access matrix $A$ to see if $T \in A[S_0,X]$ 
  - Yes, access is granted
    - $A$ may be updated by this access. e.g. copy an access right
  - No, access is denied and the violation is recorded and reported

8 access control system commands
---
| Rule | Command (by $S_0$) | Operation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $R_1$ | transfer {$T^‚ãÜ, T$} to $S,X$ | store {$T^‚ãÜ, T$} in $A[S,X]$ | 
| $R_2$ | grant {$T^‚ãÜ, T$} to $S,X$ | store {$T^‚ãÜ, T$} in $A[S,X]$ | 
| $R_3$ | delete $T$ from $S,X$ | delete $T$ from $A[S,X]$ | 
| $R_4$ |  $w ‚Üê read\ S,X$ | copy $A[S,X]$  into $w$ | 
| $R_5$ | create object $X$ | add column for $X$ to $A$; store 'owner' in $A[S_0,X]$  | 
| $R_6$ | destroy object $X$ | delete column of $X$ from $A$ |
| $R_7$ | create subject $S$ | add row for $S$ to $A$; create object $S$; store 'control' in $A[S,S]$  | 
| $R_8$ | destroy subject $S$ | delete row of $S$ from $A$; destroy object $S$; |


üí° Demo 
---
- [Traditional UNIX File Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File-system_permissions)
- subjects: user (owner), group, and other
- objects: files and directories
- access rights: read, write, and execute

```bash
# 1. list permissions of a file
ls -l afile

# 2. list permissions of a directory
ls -ld adirectory

# 3. change permissions
chmod {options} filename
```

[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control)
---
- simplifies DAC by abstracting the access rights shared by a group of subjects into role
  - roles have hierarchies
- decouples access rights from subjects
- typically defines a role as a job function within an organization
- a user can be assigned more than one roles statically or dynamically
  - according to the principle of least privileges
- widely used now and required by [FIPS PUB 140-3: Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-3/final)
- modelled with two matrixes
  - role assignment matrix assigns subjects with roles 
  - role access rights matrix specifies the access rights of each role on the resources

Relationship among RBAC models
---
-  A Family of Role-Based Access Control Models 
   - $RBAC_0$ is the minimum requirement for an RBAC system
     - contains four types of entities: user, role, permission, session
   - $RBAC_1$ adds role hierarchies
     - reflect the hierarchical structure of roles in an organization
   - $RBAC_2$ adds constraints
   - $RBAC_3$ includes RBAC 1 and RBAC 2
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  R0("RBAC0 
  Base model")
  R1("RBAC1
  Role hierarchies")
  R2("RBAC2
  Constraints")
  R3("RBAC3
  Consolidated model")
  R1---R3
  R3---R2
  R1---R0
  R0---R2
```

Scope RBAC Models
---
| Models | Hierarchies | Constraints |
| --- | --- | --- |
| $RBAC_0$ | No | No |
| $RBAC_1$ | Yes | No |
| $RBAC_2$ | No | Yes |
| $RBAC_3$ | Yes | Yes |


RBAC Constraints 
---
- Means of adapting RBAC to the specifics of administrative and security policies of an organization
- Relationships among roles or conditions related to roles
- Types:
- Mutually exclusive roles
  - A user can only be assigned to one role in the set (either during a session or statically)
  - Any permission (access right) can be granted to only one role in the set
- Cardinality
  - Setting a maximum number of users, permissions for roles
- Prerequisite roles
  - A user can only be assigned to a particular role if it is already assigned to some other specified roles


[Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/162/upd2/final)
---
- defines authorizations conditioning on attributes of subjects ($S$), objects ($O$), operations $T$, and environment $E$
- flexible and expressive
  - Allows an unlimited number of attributes to be combined to satisfy any access control rule
- capable of enforcing DAC, RBAC, and MAC concepts
- adoption obstacles in real systems:
  - inefficient to evaluate $Predicate(S,O,T,E)$ for each access
- Web services implemented ABAC by the [eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XAMCL)](http://xml.coverpages.org/xacml.html)
- cloud services welcome ABAC


Basic ABAC Scenario
---
- ![NIST SP 800-162 Figure 2](../../figs/ABAC.png)
- three ABAC key elements
  - attributes: defined for entities in a configuration
  - a policy model: defines the ABAC policies
  - an architecture model: applies to policies that enforce access control


ABAC Logical Architecture: ACL vs. ABAC
---
- ACL: the root of trust is with the object owner
- ![NIST SP 800-162 Figure 7](../../figs/ACLTrustChain.png)
- ABAC: the root of trust is derived from many sources
- ![NIST SP 800-162 Figure 8](../../figs/ABACTrustChain.png)


ABAC Policies
---
- predefined attributes: $SA_k (1‚â§ k‚â§K), OA_m (1‚â§ m‚â§ M), EA_n (1‚â§ n‚â§ N)$
- attribute assignment relations for subject $s$, object $o$, and environment $e$:
  - $ATTR(s) ‚äÜ SA_1√ó SA_2√ó ‚ãØ √ó SA_K$
  - $ATTR(o) ‚äÜ OA_1√ó OA_2√ó ‚ãØ √ó OA_K$
  - $ATTR(e) ‚äÜ EA_1√ó EA_2√ó ‚ãØ √ó EA_K$
- function notation for the value assignment of individual attributes
  - $Role(s) = "Student"$
- a general *policy rule* is a boolean function
  - $canAccess(s,o,e) ‚üµ f(ATTR(s), ATTR(o), ATTR(e))$
-  A policy rule base or policy store may consist of a number of policy rules


üñäÔ∏è Practice
---
Given the access control policy below

| Movie rating | Users allowed access |
| --- | --- |
| R | $Age ‚â• 17$ |
| PG-13 | $Age ‚â• 13$ |
| G | Everyone |

Construct the access control models with RBAC and ABAC.
- RBAC: 
  - three roles of Adult, Juvenile and Child
  - three permissions: can view R movies, can view PG-13 movies, can view G movies
  - access control

| R\V\M | R | PG-13 | G |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Adult | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 
| Juvenile  |  | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | 
| Child  |  |  | ‚úÖ | 

- ABAC
  - $canAccess(u,m,e) ‚üµ$
  - $(Age(u)‚â•17 ‚à© Rating(m)‚àà \{R, PG-13, G\}) ‚à™$
  - $(Age(u)‚â•13 ‚à© (Age(u)<17 ‚à© Rating(m)‚àà \{PG-13, G\}) ‚à™$
  - $(Age(u)<13 ‚à© Rating(m)‚àà \{G\})$


Identity, Credential, and Access Management (ICAM)
---
- A comprehensive approach developed by the U.S. government
- Designed to 
  - Create trusted digital identity representations of individuals and nonperson entities (NPEs)
  - Bind those identities to credentials that may serve as a proxy for the individual of NPE in access transaction
    - A credential is an object or data structure that authoritatively binds an identity to a token possessed and controlled by a subscriber
  - Use the credentials to provide authorized access to an agency‚Äôs resources


Identity Management
---
- Assigns digital identity (DI) to an individual or NPE
  - assigns attributes to a DI
- establish a trustworthy DI independent of a specific context
  - to use applications
- maintain and protect DIs
  - Mechanisms, policies, and procedures for protecting personal identity information
  - Controlling access to identity data
  - Techniques for sharing authoritative identity data with applications that need it
  - Revocation of an enterprise identity


Credential Management
---
- manages life cycle of credentials such as digital certificates, smart cards
  - biographic and biometric info verification, enrollment, generation, issuance, revocation
  - replacement, re-enrollment, expiration, PIN reset, suspension, or reinstatement


Access Management
---
- manages and controls the ways entities are granted access to resources
- ensures proper identity verification and permission grant
- Three elements for an enterprise-wide access control facility:
  - Resource management
  - Privilege management
  - Policy management



Identity Federation
---
- describes the technology, standards, policies, and processes that 
  - allow an organization to trust digital identities, identity attributes, and credentials created and issued by another organization
- Addresses two questions:
  - How do you trust identities of individuals from external organizations who need access to your systems?
  - How do you vouch for identities of individuals in your organization when they need to collaborate with external organizations?


Traditional Identity Exchange Approach
---
```mermaid
flowchart LR
  I(Identity service provider)
  R(Relying party)
  U(Users)
  I <-->|"Possible contract"|R
  I <-->|"TOS agreement"|U
  U <-->|"TOS agreement"|R
```
- TOS: terms of service
- Both parties need to have a level of trust about security and privacy issues
