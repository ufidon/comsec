## Types of Malware

What is [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)?
---
- [NIST 800-83](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/83/r1/final) defines malware as:
- a program that is inserted into a system, 
  - usually covertly, with the intent of compromising 
    - the confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
      - of the victim‚Äôs data, applications, or operating system 
    - or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim


Classification of Malware
---
- Classified into two broad categories based on
  - how it spreads or propagates to the targets
  - the actions or payloads it performs on the targets
- classified by existence form
  - Those that need a host program (parasitic code such as viruses)
  - Those that are independent, self-contained programs (worms, trojans, and bots)
- classified by replication capability
  - Malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam e-mail)
  - Malware that does replicate (viruses and worms)


Types of Malware
---
- Propagation mechanisms (replication methods):
  - Infect existing files by viruses 
  - Exploit software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads 
  - Social-engineer users to install Trojans or to respond to phishing attacks
- Payloads:

  - modifies data flow between the browser and Web sites


[Phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing) and Identity Theft
---
- Exploits social engineering to leverage the user‚Äôs trust by masquerading as communication from a trusted source
  - Include a URL in a spam e-mail that links to a fake Web site that mimics the login page of a banking, gaming, or similar site
  - Suggests that urgent action is required by the user to authenticate their account
  - Attacker exploits the account using the captured credentials
- Spear phishing
  - Recipients are carefully researched by the attacker
  - E-mail is crafted to specifically suit its recipient, often quoting a range of information to convince them of its authenticity

Malware Countermeasure Approaches
---
- Ideal solution to the threat of malware is prevention
- Four main elements of prevention:
  - Policy
  - Awareness
  - Vulnerability mitigation
  - Threat mitigation
- If prevention fails, technical mechanisms can be used to support the following threat mitigation options:
  - Detection
  - Identification
  - Removal


[Generations of Anti-Virus Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antivirus_software)
---
- First generation: simple scanners
  - Requires a malware signature to identify the malware
  - Limited to the detection of known malware
- Second generation: heuristic scanners
  - Uses heuristic rules to search for probable malware instances
  - Another approach is integrity checking
- Third generation: activity traps
  - Memory-resident programs that identify malware by its actions rather than its structure in an infected program
- Fourth generation: full-featured protection
  - Packages consisting of a variety of anti-virus techniques used in conjunction
  - Include scanning and activity trap components and access control capability


[Sandbox Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(computer_security))
---
- Running potentially malicious code in an emulated sandbox or on a virtual machine
- Allows the code to execute in a controlled environment where its behavior can be closely monitored without threatening the security of a real system
- Running potentially malicious software in such environments enables the detection of complex encrypted, polymorphic, or metamorphic malware
- The most difficult design issue with sandbox analysis is to determine how long to run each interpretation


Host-Based Behavior-Blocking Software
---
- Integrates with the operating system of a host computer and monitors program behavior in real time for malicious action 
  - Blocks potentially malicious actions before they have a chance to affect the system
  - Blocks software in real time so it has an advantage over anti-virus detection techniques such as fingerprinting or heuristics
- Limitations
  - Because malicious code must run on the target machine before all its behaviors can be identified, it can cause harm before it has been detected and blocked


Perimeter Scanning Approaches
---
- Anti-virus software typically included in e-mail and Web proxy services running on an organization‚Äôs firewall and IDS
- May also be included in the traffic analysis component of an IDS
- May include intrusion prevention measures, blocking the flow of any suspicious traffic
- Approach is limited to scanning malware
- Two types of monitoring software
  - Ingress monitors
    - Located at the border between the enterprise network and the Internet 
    - One technique is to look for incoming traffic to unused local IP addresses
  - Egress monitors
    - Located at the egress point of individual LANs as well as at the border between the enterprise network and the Internet 
    - Monitors outgoing traffic for signs of scanning or other suspicious behavior


Terminology for malware
---
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) | Cybercrime directed at business and political targets, using a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware, applied persistently and effectively to specific targets over an extended period, often attributed to state-sponsored organizations. |
| Adware | Advertising that is integrated into software. It can result in pop-up ads or redirection of a browser to a commercial site. |
| Attack kit | Set of tools for generating new malware automatically using a variety of supplied propagation and payload mechanisms. |
| Auto-rooter | Malicious hacker tools used to break into new machines remotely. |
| Backdoor (trapdoor) | Any mechanism that bypasses a normal security check; it may allow unauthorized access to functionality in a program, or onto a compromised system. |
| Downloaders | Code that installs other items on a machine that is under attack. It is normally included in the malware code first inserted on to a compromised system to then import a larger malware package. |
| Drive-by-download | An attack using code on a compromised website that exploits a browser Vulnerability to attack a client system when the site is viewed. |
| Exploits | Code specific to a single vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities. |
| Flooders (DoS client) | Used to generate a large volume of data to attack networked computer systems, by carrying out some form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. |
| Keyloggers | Captures keystrokes on a compromised system. | 
| Logic bomb | Code inserted into malware by an intruder. A logic bomb lies dormant until a Predefined condition is met; the code then triggers some payload. |
| Macro virus | A type of virus that uses macro or scripting code, typically embedded in a Document or document template, and triggered when the document is viewed or edited, to run and replicate itself into other such documents. |
| Mobile code | Software (e.g., script and macro) that can be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and execute with identical semantics. |
| Rootkit | Set of hacker tools used after attacker has broken into a computer system and gained root-level access. |
| Spammer programs | Used to send large volumes of unwanted e-mail. |
| Spyware | Software that collects information from a computer and transmits it to another system by monitoring keystrokes, screen data, and/or network traffic; or by scanning files on the system for sensitive information. |
| Trojan horse | A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes it. |
| Virus | Malware that, when executed, tries to replicate itself into other executable machine or script code; when it succeeds, the code is said to be infected. When the infected code is executed, the virus also executes. |
| Worm | A computer program that can run independently and can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other hosts on a network, by exploiting software vulnerabilities in the target system, or using captured authorization credentials. |
| Zombie, bot | Program installed on an infected machine that is activated to launch attacks on other machines. |
