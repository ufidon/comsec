## Types of Malware

What is [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)?
---
- [NIST 800-83](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/83/r1/final) defines malware as:
- a program that is inserted into a system, 
  - usually covertly, with the intent of compromising 
    - the confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
      - of the victim‚Äôs data, applications, or operating system 
    - or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim


Classification of Malware
---
- Classified into two broad categories based on
  - how it spreads or propagates to the targets
  - the actions or payloads it performs on the targets
- classified by existence form
  - Those that need a host program (parasitic code such as viruses)
  - Those that are independent, self-contained programs (worms, trojans, and bots)
- classified by replication capability
  - Malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam e-mail)
  - Malware that does replicate (viruses and worms)


Types of Malware
---
- Propagation mechanisms (replication methods):
  - Infect existing files by viruses 
  - Exploit software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads 
  - Social-engineer users to install Trojans or to respond to phishing attacks
- Payloads:
  - Corrupt target system/data files
  - Make the target a zombie as part of a botnet
  - Steal information/service from the target
  - Hide its presence on the victim target


Attack Kits/exploit Kits/crimeware
---
- The development and deployment of malware require considerable technical skills 
- Malware-creation toolkits ease malware development and deployment
  - include a variety of propagation mechanisms and payload modules 
  - generate variants of malware

## Malware Propagation
- Infect content by viruses
- Exploit vulnerabilities by worms
- Social engineer with spam emails and trojans


[Viruses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_virus)
---
- Piece of software that infects programs
  - Injects them with a copy of the virus
  - Replicates and goes on to infect other programs
  - Easily spreads through network
- The virus can do anything that the infected program is permitted to do
  - Executes secretly when the host program is running
- Specific to operating system and hardware
  - Takes advantage of their capabilities and weaknesses


Viruses components
---
- Infection mechanism / infection vector
  - How the virus propagates
- Trigger / logic bomb
  - When and how the virus activates or delivers its payload 
- Payload
  - What the virus does (besides spreading)
    - damage or pranks


Virus phases
---
| Phase | Activities |
| --- | --- |
| Dormant | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èVirus is idle<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èWill eventually be activated by some event<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èNot all viruses have this stage |
| Trigger | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èVirus is activated to deliver its payload<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èCan be caused by a variety of system events |
| Propagation | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èVirus inject a copy of itself into other programs or certain disk areas<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èMay not be identical to the propagating version<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èEach infected program will enter a propagation phase |
| Execution | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èPlayload is delivered<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èMay be pranking or damaging |


Macro and Scripting Viruses
---
- attaches itself to documents 
- infects scripting code used to support active content in a variety of user document types
  - e.g. word, excel, pdf
- uses the macro programming capabilities of the document‚Äôs application to execute and propagate
- characteristics
  - platform independent by using scripting languages
    - easier to write or modify
  - infect documents instead of programs
  - easily to spread
    - file system access controls usually check programs instead of documents

- Exploits software vulnerabilities in client or server programs
- replicates and propagates through 
  - Electronic mail or instant messenger facility
    - e-mails a copy of itself to other systems
    - Sends itself as an attachment via an instant message service
  - File sharing
    - Creates a copy of itself or infects a file as a virus on removable media

- can be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms 
  - and executed with identical semantics
  - e.g., script, macro, or other portable instruction such as
    - Java applets, ActiveX, JavaScript, VBScript, etc.
- acts as a mechanism for a virus, worm, or Trojan horse
- common malicious operations
  - Cross-site scripting

Client-Side Vulnerabilities and Drive-by-Downloads
---
- Exploits browser and plugin vulnerabilities 
- downloads and installs malware on the system without the user‚Äôs knowledge or consent
  - when the user views a webpage controlled by the attacker
- usually does not actively propagate as a worm does
- Spreads when users visit the malicious Web page


Watering-Hole Attacks
---
- variants of drive-by-downloads used in highly targeted attacks
  - ambush on websites
- compromise the vulnerable websites frequently visited by intended victims
- the intended victims are attacked once they visit one of the compromised websites
- may take no action for other visitors to the website
  - increases the likelihood of remaining undetected


[Malvertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising)
---
- injects malware-laden advertisements into legitimate advertising networks and webpages without compromising the system
- grows rapidly because they are easy to deploy and hard to track
- targets and displays to intended victims only
  - this greatly reduces their visibility
- The malwares reduce the chance of detection and infect specific systems using dynamic generation

---
- overlays multiple transparent or opaque layers on a normal button or link to trick a user into clicking 
  - also known as user-interface (UI) redress attack
- keystrokes can also be hijacked by similar masquerading textboxes
  - intercepts user ids, passwords, etc.
- intercepted mouse clicks and keystrokes can be used to triger further malicous activities


[Social Engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_(security))
---
- Tricks victims to assist in the compromise of their own systems
- typical methods: 
  - [*pretexting*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretexting) tricks users with a devised scenario
  - [*water holing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watering_hole_attack) exploits the trust users have in familiar websites
  - *baiting* uses physical media and relies on the curiosity or greed of the victim
- typical software tools:
  - spam emails, mails and SMS (short message service)

Terminology for malware
---
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) | Cybercrime directed at business and political targets, using a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware, applied persistently and effectively to specific targets over an extended period, often attributed to state-sponsored organizations. |
| Adware | Advertising that is integrated into software. It can result in pop-up ads or redirection of a browser to a commercial site. |
| Attack kit | Set of tools for generating new malware automatically using a variety of supplied propagation and payload mechanisms. |
| Auto-rooter | Malicious hacker tools used to break into new machines remotely. |
| Backdoor (trapdoor) | Any mechanism that bypasses a normal security check; it may allow unauthorized access to functionality in a program, or onto a compromised system. |
| Downloaders | Code that installs other items on a machine that is under attack. It is normally included in the malware code first inserted on to a compromised system to then import a larger malware package. |
| Drive-by-download | An attack using code on a compromised website that exploits a browser Vulnerability to attack a client system when the site is viewed. |
| Exploits | Code specific to a single vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities. |
| Flooders (DoS client) | Used to generate a large volume of data to attack networked computer systems, by carrying out some form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. |
| Keyloggers | Captures keystrokes on a compromised system. | 
| Logic bomb | Code inserted into malware by an intruder. A logic bomb lies dormant until a Predefined condition is met; the code then triggers some payload. |
| Macro virus | A type of virus that uses macro or scripting code, typically embedded in a Document or document template, and triggered when the document is viewed or edited, to run and replicate itself into other such documents. |
| Mobile code | Software (e.g., script and macro) that can be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and execute with identical semantics. |
| Rootkit | Set of hacker tools used after attacker has broken into a computer system and gained root-level access. |
| Spammer programs | Used to send large volumes of unwanted e-mail. |
| Spyware | Software that collects information from a computer and transmits it to another system by monitoring keystrokes, screen data, and/or network traffic; or by scanning files on the system for sensitive information. |
| Trojan horse | A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes it. |
| Virus | Malware that, when executed, tries to replicate itself into other executable machine or script code; when it succeeds, the code is said to be infected. When the infected code is executed, the virus also executes. |
| Worm | A computer program that can run independently and can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other hosts on a network, by exploiting software vulnerabilities in the target system, or using captured authorization credentials. |
| Zombie, bot | Program installed on an infected machine that is activated to launch attacks on other machines. |
