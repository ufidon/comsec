What is [malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware)?
---
- [NIST 800-83](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/83/r1/final) defines malware as:
- a program that is inserted into a system, 
  - usually covertly, with the intent of compromising 
    - the confidentiality, integrity, or availability 
      - of the victimâ€™s data, applications, or operating system 
    - or otherwise annoying or disrupting the victim


Classification of Malware
---
- Classified into two broad categories based on
  - how it spreads or propagates to the targets
  - the actions or payloads it performs on the targets
- classified by existence form
  - Those that need a host program (parasitic code such as viruses)
  - Those that are independent, self-contained programs (worms, trojans, and bots)
- classified by replication capability
  - Malware that does not replicate (trojans and spam e-mail)
  - Malware that does replicate (viruses and worms)


Types of Malware
---
- Propagation mechanisms:
  - Infection of existing content by viruses that is subsequently spread to other systems
  - Exploit of software vulnerabilities by worms or drive-by-downloads to allow the malware to replicate
  - Social engineering attacks that convince users to bypass security mechanisms to install Trojans or to respond to phishing attacks
- Payloads:
  - Corruption of system or data files
  - Theft of service/make the system a zombie agent of attack as part of a botnet
  - Theft of information from the system
  - Hiding its presence on the system


Attack/exploit Kits/crimeware
---
- The development and deployment of malware require considerable technical skill 
- Malware-creation toolkits help novices develop and deploy malware
  - includes a variety of propagation mechanisms and payload modules 
  - generate variants of malware

Terminology for malware
---
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) | Cybercrime directed at business and political targets, using a wide variety of intrusion technologies and malware, applied persistently and effectively to specific targets over an extended period, often attributed to state-sponsored organizations. |
| Adware | Advertising that is integrated into software. It can result in pop-up ads or redirection of a browser to a commercial site. |
| Attack kit | Set of tools for generating new malware automatically using a variety of supplied propagation and payload mechanisms. |
| Auto-rooter | Malicious hacker tools used to break into new machines remotely. |
| Backdoor (trapdoor) | Any mechanism that bypasses a normal security check; it may allow unauthorized access to functionality in a program, or onto a compromised system. |
| Downloaders | Code that installs other items on a machine that is under attack. It is normally included in the malware code first inserted on to a compromised system to then import a larger malware package. |
| Drive-by-download | An attack using code on a compromised website that exploits a browser Vulnerability to attack a client system when the site is viewed. |
| Exploits | Code specific to a single vulnerability or set of vulnerabilities. |
| Flooders (DoS client) | Used to generate a large volume of data to attack networked computer systems, by carrying out some form of denial-of-service (DoS) attack. |
| Keyloggers | Captures keystrokes on a compromised system. | 
| Logic bomb | Code inserted into malware by an intruder. A logic bomb lies dormant until a Predefined condition is met; the code then triggers some payload. |
| Macro virus | A type of virus that uses macro or scripting code, typically embedded in a Document or document template, and triggered when the document is viewed or edited, to run and replicate itself into other such documents. |
| Mobile code | Software (e.g., script and macro) that can be shipped unchanged to a heterogeneous collection of platforms and execute with identical semantics. |
| Rootkit | Set of hacker tools used after attacker has broken into a computer system and gained root-level access. |
| Spammer programs | Used to send large volumes of unwanted e-mail. |
| Spyware | Software that collects information from a computer and transmits it to another system by monitoring keystrokes, screen data, and/or network traffic; or by scanning files on the system for sensitive information. |
| Trojan horse | A computer program that appears to have a useful function, but also has a hidden and potentially malicious function that evades security mechanisms, sometimes by exploiting legitimate authorizations of a system entity that invokes it. |
| Virus | Malware that, when executed, tries to replicate itself into other executable machine or script code; when it succeeds, the code is said to be infected. When the infected code is executed, the virus also executes. |
| Worm | A computer program that can run independently and can propagate a complete working version of itself onto other hosts on a network, by exploiting software vulnerabilities in the target system, or using captured authorization credentials. |
| Zombie, bot | Program installed on an infected machine that is activated to launch attacks on other machines. |
