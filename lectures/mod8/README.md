[Intrusion Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_detection_system)
---
- security intrusion: 
  - Unauthorized act of bypassing the security mechanisms of a system
- intrusion detection: 
  - A hardware or software function 
  - gathers and analyzes information from various areas within a computer or a network 
  - identifies ¬≠ possible security intrusions


Intrusion Detection System (IDS) components
---
- Sensors
  - collect evidences of an intrusion such as
    - network packets, log files, and system call traces
    - file integrity checksums, registry access
- Analyzers
  - aggregate the evidences
  - determine whether an intrusion has occurred
  - provide guidance about reactions to the intrusion
- User interfaces let users
  - view reports
  - configure and control the behavior of the system


Basic Principles for IDS
---
- Quick detection
  - better detect the intrusion before any damage or compromise
- Serving as a deterrent to intruders
- Collecting intrusion techniques to improve future detection
- Based on the assumption that the intruder behavior is different from legitimate user
  - the decision is based on a set of criteria
    - looser criteria lead to more false positives
    - stricter criteria lead to more false negatives 
- It is challenging to achieve a high rate of detections with a low rate of false alarms
  - a limit imposed by the nature of probabilities [base-rate fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_rate_fallacy)
  - when the numbers of intrusions is far less than the number of legitimate uses

- List the requirements on processing, function, output, technique and miscellaneousness


Intrusion Analysis Approaches
---
- Anomaly Detection
  - get patterns of legitimate behavior over a period of time
  - intrusion typically deviates from normal *behavior patterns*
  - based on defined normal or expected behavior 
- Signature-based Detection
  - compare current observed data with a set of known malicious *data patterns*
- Heuristic Detection
  - compare current observed data with a set of known malicious *attack rules*
- The last two approaches are also called misuse detection
  - based on defined malicious patterns and rules
- Anomaly detection typically has higher level of false alarm than misuse detection
  - but is slower and more inefficient


[IDS Anomaly Detection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anomaly-based_intrusion_detection_system)
---
- develops the model of normal behavior before hand and evolves continuously
- typical ways to develop the models
  - statistical models such as univariate, multivariate, or time-series models
  - knowledge-based models based on a set of rules defining legitimate behavior
  - machine-learning models trained and verified with historical datasets


Machine-learning approaches for anomaly detection
---
- Bayesian networks
- Markov models
- Neural networks
- Fuzzy logic
- Genetic algorithms
- Clustering and outlier detection

Signature or Heuristic Detection
---
- Signature approaches
  - Match observed data against a large collection of known signatures of malicious data
  - The signatures need to be large enough to cover the scale of malicious data
  - Widely used in anti-virus products and NIDS
- Rule-based heuristic identification
  - Use rules to identify known attacks or penetrations
    - also to identify suspicious behavior
  - rules are typically specific to the machine and operating system
  - SNORT is an example of a rule-based NIDS

- Network-based IDS (NIDS)
- Distributed or hybrid IDS


[Host-based IDS (HIDS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Host-based_intrusion_detection_system)
---
- Installed on a single host
  - add a layer of security
- monitors and analyzes 
  - the internals of the host such as
    - system call traces
      - typically through [os hooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooking)
      - hard to apply on Windows due to the extensive use of DLLs
    - memory access
    - hardware access
    - registry access, specific to Windows

Network-based IDS (NIDS)
---
- Installed on routers or edge firewalls
- Comprised of 
  - a number of sensors, including two types
    - inline sensor with traffic pass through
    - passive sensor eavesdrop traffic
  - one or more servers for NIDS management functions 
  - one or more management consoles for the human interface
- Monitors and analyzes pass-through network traffic in real or close to real time
- May examine protocol activities on all network layers
- Analysis of traffic patterns may be done at 
  - the sensor, the management server or 
  - a combination of the two


Distributed or hybrid IDS
---
- Combines information from a number of sensors, 
  - often both host (host agent module) and 
  - network (LAN monitor agent module) based, 
- feeds in a central analyzer (central manager module)
- able to better identify and respond to intrusion activities


Intrusion Detection Techniques
---
- Defined and exemplified in [NIST SP 800-94: Guide to Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) section 2.3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/94/final)
- Attack examples and suitable detection technique

| Detection tech | Attacks |  
| --- | --- | 
| Signature detection | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èReconnaissance and attacks on all network layers<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èUnexpected application services<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èPolicy violations |
| Anomaly Detection | ‚ñ∂Ô∏èDenial-of-service (DoS) attacks<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èScanning<br>‚ñ∂Ô∏èWorms |


Stateful Protocol Analysis (SPA)
---
- Defined in [NIST SP 800-94 section 2.3](https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/sp/800/94/final)
- A subset of anomaly detection 
  - compares observed network traffic against *predetermined universal vendor supplied profiles of benign protocol traffic*
  - but anomaly techniques trained with organization specific traffic protocols
- Stateful means it understands and tracks network, transport, and application protocol states to ensure they progress as expected
- A key disadvantage is resource consuming


Typical information logged by a NIDS sensor
---
- Timestamp
- Connection or session ID
- Event or alert type
- Rating  (e.g., priority, severity, impact, confidence)
- Network, transport, and application layer protocols
- Source and destination IP addresses
- Source and destination TCP or UDP ports, or ICMP types and codes
- Number of bytes transmitted over the connection
- Decoded payload data, such as application requests and responses
- State-related information


Distributed or Hybrid Intrusion Detection
---
- Distributed systems cooperate to identify intrusions and adapt to
changing attack profiles
- an example: autonomic enterprise security system
- Usually consists of
  - a central IDS inputs three types of events
    - *summary events* summarize information collected from network segments
    - *Distributed detection and inference (DDI) events* alert that an attack is under way
    - *Policy enforcement points (PEPs) events* show intrusions synthesized from distributed information
  - multiple HIDS and NIDS
- Integrate [security information and event management (SIEM) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_information_and_event_management)
- share information


IETF Intrusion Detection Working Group
---
- defines data formats and exchange procedures for sharing information of interest to intrusion detection, response systems and management systems
  - [Intrusion Detection Exchange Format (IDMEF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrusion_Detection_Message_Exchange_Format) defined in [RFC 4765](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4765.txt)
  - The Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP) defined in [RFC 4767](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4767.txt)
  - Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Requirements defined in [RFC 4766](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4766.txt)


Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Requirements
---
- defines requirements for the Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF)
- specifies requirements for a communication protocol for IDMEF


The Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format
---
- describes a data model to represent the information exported by IDS 
  - explains the rationale for using this model
- presents an implementation of the data model in Extensible Markup Language (XML)
  - develops XML Document Type Definition (DTD), 
  - provides examples


The Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol
---
- describes the Intrusion Detection Exchange Protocol (IDXP), 
  - an application level protocol for exchanging data between intrusion detection entities
- IDXP supports mutual authentication, integrity, and confidentiality over a connection oriented protocol

[Honeypots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honeypot_(computing))
---
- Decoy systems designed to
  - Lure a potential attacker away from critical systems
  - Collect information about the attacker‚Äôs activity
  - Encourage the attacker to stay on the system long enough for administrators to respond
- Systems are filled with fabricated information that a legitimate user of the system wouldn‚Äôt access
- Resources that have no production value
  - Therefore incoming communication is most likely a probe, scan, or attack
  - Initiated outbound communication suggests that the system has probably been compromised
- typical deployment locations relative to corporation network
  - outside the external firewall
  - the DMZ (demilitarized zone) for outward services such as web and mail
  - inside the corporate network


Honeypot Classifications
---
- Low interaction honeypot
  - Consists of a software package that emulates particular I T services or systems well enough to provide a realistic initial interaction, but does not execute a full version of those services or systems
  - Provides a less realistic target
  - Often sufficient for use as a component of a distributed I D S to warn of imminent attack
- High interaction honeypot
  - A real system, with a full operating system, services and applications, which are instrumented and deployed where they can be accessed by attackers
  - Is a more realistic target that may occupy an attacker for an extended period
  - However, it requires significantly more resources
  - If compromised could be used to initiate attacks on other systems
