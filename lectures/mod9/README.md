Defense in depth
---
- Most organizations have internet connectivity today
  - threats are introduced
- Effective *means* of protecting LANs are needed
  - the means could be IDS, IPS, IDPS, firewall, or combined
  - Inserted between the premises network and the Internet to establish a controlled link
    - Used as a perimeter defense
    - Single choke point to impose security and auditing
    - Insulates the internal systems from external networks
  - Can be a single computer system or a set of two or more systems working together


Firewall design goals
---
- All traffic between inside and outside must pass through the firewall
  - Only traffic authorized by security policy will be allowed to pass
- The firewall is immune to penetration


Firewall Access Policy
---
- A critical component in firewall planning and implementation
  - lists the types of traffic authorized to pass through the firewall
    - based on address ranges, protocols, applications and content
- developed from 
  - the organization‚Äôs information security risk assessment and policy
  - a broad specification of allowed traffic types
- refined to detail the network traffic filters


Network traffic characteristics used by firewall filters
---
- IP address and protocol values
  - used by packet filter and stateful inspection firewalls
  - Typically used to limit access to specific services
- Application protocol
  - used by an application-level gateway that relays and monitors the exchange of information for specific application protocols
- User identity
  - Typically for inside users who identify themselves using some form of secure authentication technology
- Network activity
  - such as request timestamp, request rate, or other activity patterns


Firewall Capabilities And Limits
---
- Capabilities:
  - Defines a single choke point
    - Provides a location for monitoring security events
    - Integrates several Internet functions that are not security related
  - Can serve as the platform for IPSec and VPN
- Limitations:
  - Cannot protect against attacks bypassing firewall
  - May not protect fully against internal threats
  - Improperly secured wireless LAN can be accessed from outside the organization
  - Infected laptop, PDA, or portable storage device may be used internally


Types of Firewalls
---
- packet filtering firewall
- stateful inspection firewall
- application proxy firewall
- circuit-level proxy firewall


[Packet Filtering Firewall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Packet_Filter)
---
- Applies rules to each incoming and outgoing IP packet
  - Typically a list of rules based on matches in the IP or TCP header
  - Forwards or discards the packet based on rules match
- Filtering rules are based on information contained in a network packet
  - Source and destination IP address
  - Source and destination port number
  - IP protocol fields
  - mac address specified interface
- Two default policies:
  - Discard - prohibit unless expressly permitted
    - More conservative, controlled, visible to users
  - Forward - permit unless expressly prohibited
    - Easier to manage and use but less secure

Packet Filter Advantages And Weaknesses
---
- Advantages
  - Simplicity
  - Typically transparent to users and are very fast
- Weaknesses
  - Cannot prevent attacks that employ application specific vulnerabilities or functions
  - Limited logging functionality
  - Do not support advanced user authentication
  - Vulnerable to attacks on TCP/IP protocol bugs
  - Improper configuration can lead to breaches
